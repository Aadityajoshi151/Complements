# 1's and 2's Complement in C++
## Important:
I wrote this program when I was in my first year and I posted it on a simple blog that I created at that time (PEC-World.weebly.com). Recently I decided to move all my projects to github and I have taken down this blog. Since I wrote this is in 2017 it has some mistakes here and there but it works fine. I also know this project would have been more easy if I had written it in python but I didn't know python at that time. Here is the exact copy of the post that I wrote on my blog on 13 Nov 2017 ðŸ‘‡

## Description
#### The program to find out 1's and 2's complement of a Binary Number

â€‹**1â€™s Complement:**  
The ones' complement of a binary number is defined as the value obtained by inverting all the bits in the binary representation of the number.  
1â€™s complement of a binary number is obtained by subtracting each digit from 1. However, when subtracting binary digits from 1, we can have either 1 â€“ 0 = 1 or 1 â€“ 1 = 0, which causes the bit to change from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.  
For example,  
The 1â€™s complement of 1011000 is 0100111.  
  
**2â€™s Complement:**  
Two's complement is a mathematical operation on binary numbers, as well as a binary signed number representation based on this operation. Its wide use in computing makes it the most important example of a radix complement.  
To find 2â€™s complement of a binary number, we first find the 1â€™s complement and add 1 to it.  
Remember we are talking about binary addition of 1 where 1 + 1 = 0 and a carry of 1 is generated on the next digit.  
  
To implement this concept in C++, the 1â€™s complement part was easy but the 2â€™s complement took some serious thinking (at least for me).  
Since we are using array for taking input and storing the binary number, the 1â€™s complement was a piece of cake (just change 0 to 1 and 1 to 0).  
  
For 2â€™s complement, the problem was that adding â€˜1â€™ to 1â€™s complement will make that particular digit â€˜2â€™ because compiler does not know that in binary 1+1 is 0.  
The original idea that I had in mind consisted of 5 steps:  

1.  Take the input as binary number.
2.  Obtain 1â€™s complement.
3.  Convert that 1â€™s complement in decimal number system.
4.  Add 1 to the obtained decimal value.
5.  Convert that decimal value back into binary.

But this idea was very long to code and was only successful in 10% cases. In rest 90% cases, it was a failure. Although the problem was solvable by using setprecision() and setw() operators in C++ but that increased the lines of code even more.  
By rethinking, what seemed to the problem turned out to be the solution. Add 1 to the 1â€™s complement. Let it become â€˜2â€™. By running a reversed FOR loop, just change the bit which is 2 to 0 and add 1 to the next bit. All this happens in a loop so all the bits are changed (if required) and the 2â€™s complement is obtained. The algorithm in SOME way FAINTLY resembles sorting techniques.

    
    //THIS PROGRAM IS WRITTEN BY AADITYA JOSHI
	#include <iostream>
	using namespace std;
	int main()
	{
	    int a[100], i, n;
	    system("cls");
	    cout << "Enter The Length Of Binary Number " << endl;
	    cin >> n;
	    cout << "Enter The Binary Number. Press Enter After Entering Each Element " << endl;
	    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
	    {
	        cin >> a[i];
	    }
	    system("cls");
	    cout << "The Entered Number :- ";
	    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
	    {
	        cout << a[i];
	    }
	    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
	    {
	        if (a[i] == 0)
	            a[i] = a[i] + 1;
	        else if (a[i] == 1)
	            a[i] = a[i] - 1;
	    }
	    cout << "\nThe 1's Complement Is :- ";
	    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
	    {
	        cout << a[i];
	    }
	    a[n - 1] = a[n - 1] + 1;
	    for (i = (n - 1); i >= 0; i--)
	    {
	        if (a[i] == 2)
	        {
	            a[i] = 0;
	            a[i - 1] += 1;
	        }
	    }
	    cout << "\nThe 2's Complement Is :- ";
	    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
	    {
	        cout << a[i];
	    }
	    cout << endl;
	    system("pause");
	}
As there are pros and cons of everything, the con I see of this program is the user has to enter the binary number as array. It is more convenient to enter the number has a whole rather than pressing enter after each element. Initially I started with the same approach, but was not able to do it that way. I will figure that out in the future. As there is always scope of improvement, tell me in the comments what else can be added, removed or changed.
